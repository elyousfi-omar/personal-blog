# Personal blog (work in progress)

## Introduction:
I have been learning nodejs recently, therefore as a side project I started working on a personal blog.
This web application offers following features:
- Writing blogs.
- Adding notes.
- Noting projects and courses to do(or done).
- A calendar.

## Note: 
To use the application, do not forget to configure database. In my case I used Atlas MongoDB, if you want to do the same, do not forget to add Mongo URI in app.js as dbURI variable. Example:  
const dbURI = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

## To do:
- Add a planner.
- A side TODO list.
- Improve front end.

## Interface:
I developped front end using Bootstrap 5.
